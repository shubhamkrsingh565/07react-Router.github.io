  <h1 id="fixed">Dogs or Cats?</h1>
  <h2>What kind of person are you?</h2>
  <p>The world is made up of three types of people: Cat people; dog people; and boring people.</p>

  <p>Why do you think you have a preference for one over the over?</p>

  <h3>Dogs</h3>

  <p>
    The dog's story is inexorably linked with the human's. Dogs are dogs, and not wolves, purely <br> because of human tampering. They were made by us to fit us.<br>  The same is true of almonds, but almonds don't play fetch. We took, and take, <br> the cute ones, the sweet
    ones, the ones we like the best and mold them and their offspring, <br> often to the detriment of their health, into our perfect companions. And that they are.

  <h3>Cats</h3>

  <p>Cats are graceful, clumsy, silky soft with sharp edges, softly glowing eyes in the dark, purring,<br>  kneading balls of fur curled up closely against your body warmth, intellegent, annoying, funny, <br> great conversationalists with comments about many things, and intriguing little creatures<br>  who display many emotions including affection, even love for their guardians.</p>
